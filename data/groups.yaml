A torrent of electrical and chemical signals is launched in each cell, giving rise to changes in structures and connections between cells.</p>
            <p>A key aspect of memory is the ability to relate events that occur in sequences, such as landmarks, music, movements, or words in a sentence. We study how such sequences are formed during learning, how sequences cause changes in cells and connections, and how molecular and electrical signals encode and sustain memories.</p>
            <p>We use the new technique of optogenetics to monitor, as well as stimulate, brain cell activity using light. We can literally watch brain activity during learning, to see how sequences in the real world map to sequences in the brain. We replicate such sequences by projecting light patterns onto brain tissue slices, and ask how cells 'learn'. Because these processes are so intertwined and complex, we use computer models to see how events at many levels of brain function give rise to memory. We have developed a major simulation tool called MOOSE, to build computer models from molecules to networks.</p>"

The project's novel research strategy exploits interdependencies in the experimental data to obtain dense maps of the brain, without measuring every detail of its multiple levels of organization (molecules, cells, micro-circuits, brain regions, the whole brain). This strategy allows the project to build digital reconstructions (computer models) of the brain at an unprecedented level of biological detail.  Supercomputer-based simulation of their behavior turns understanding the brain into a tractable problem, providing a new tool to study the complex interactions within different levels of brain organization and to investigate the cross-level links leading from genes to cognition.</p>"

The scientific aim is to characterize the complexity of biological systems by making inferences across nested levels of integration, along bottom-up (from microscopic to macroscopic) or top-down (from macroscopic to microscopic) axes.</p>
            <p>The different research teams at UNIC focus on three closely linked scientific issues: 1) characterizing the synaptic and cellular mechanisms engaged in the ongoing activation state and sensory evoked neural dynamics in cortical-like structures (during development and adulthood); 2) explaining/modeling the emergence of low-level perception correlates in primary sensory cortical areas; and 3) explaining/modeling the influence of lateral (intrinsic) and top-down (extrinsic) feedback connectivities. Several sensory modalities (vision, touch and haptic sense, audition, electrosensory sense) are studied in different brain structures (brainstem, thalamus, visual, auditory and somatosensory cortices, electrosensory lobe) and species (electric fish, mouse, rat, ferret, cat). Research is based on interdisciplinary approaches, ranging from electrophysiological techniques (intracellular sharp and patch recordings, dynamic clamp in vivo and in vitro, multiple simultaneous single unit recordings and local field potentials), network functional imaging (two photon and voltage sensitive dye imaging, combined with optogenetic techniques) and psychophysical measurements to databases of correlates between structure and function, theoretical neuroscience and computational modeling, as well as statistical physics and large scale simulations.</p>

            "<h4> Probing neuronal function with light</h4>
            <p>Understanding brain function requires an understanding of the communication between groups of neurons via synapses. Moreover, synaptic function is known to be altered in certain diseases and is often the site of action of clinically useful drugs. In our laboratory we study the cellular properties and molecules underlying the strength, time course, and plasticity of synaptic signaling - all parameters thought to underlie such brain functions as memory storage. To date much of our knowledge of synaptic behavior arises from electrophysiological methods such as patch-clamp. However the spatial and temporal limitations of these tools preclude a more in-depth understanding of synaptic function at single synaptic contacts. To overcome these limitations we have supplemented these classical methods with optical techniques which allow us to use light to monitor and manipulate neuronal function with submicron spatial and submillisecond temporal resolution within brain tissue. In particular we use one and two-photon imaging methods to detect synaptic function using Ca2+ indicators and neuronal integration using optical voltage probes. Our experimental objectives are to 1) characterize the detailed biophysical and cellular mechanisms regulating information transfer at single synapses, and 2) characterizing the spatial and temporal distribution of synaptic integration within single dendrites of neurons within functional networks.</p>"
