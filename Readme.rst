Cajal - The computational neuroscience laboratory map
-----------------------------------------------------

This is a tiny pet project I worked on. The idea is to mark all the laboratories carrying out computational neuroscience reseach on a world map in an attempt to make them more accessible to the community.

Please feel free to add your laboratory to the map. You can use one of the existing XML data files as a template.
