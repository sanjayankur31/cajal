Cajal - The neuroscience laboratory map
-----------------------------------------------------

This is a tiny pet project I'm workin on. The idea is to mark all the laboratories carrying out neuroscience reseach on a world map in an attempt to make them more accessible to the community.

Feel free to improve the map. There's so much that can be done. To add your laboratory to the map, you only need to modify `data/groups.yaml`. Pull requests are always welcome!

To regenerate the map, in the root folder, run:

.. code:: python

    python3 bin/populate_map.py
